This is the reposatory of the 3d printer that where built during a workshop hosted by Arduino Verkstad at the makerspace STPLN in Malmö, Sweden.

The frame "P3Steel" is a remix of Twelvepro's redesign of Josef Prusa's i3. There have been some alterations to the frame such as the deletion of the triangles covering the xz frame and some holes for a powersupply and the electronics have been added. 

Here (http://youtu.be/In_Q6NkX3fs﻿) you can find a video showing how to assemble the frame.

The plastic parts have mostly been sourced from the box design of the main Prusa i3 branch. One part was sourced from Except some that were made for this printer exclusivly. 

The new plastic parts made were the following:
The shroud for the fan
The legs for the screen
