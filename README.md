Steelwonder
===========

This is the repository of the 3d printer that where built during a workshop hosted by Arduino Verkstad at the makerspace STPLN in Malmö, Sweden.

The frame "P3Steel" is a remix of Twelvepro's redesign of Josef Prusa's i3. There have been some alterations to the frame such as the deletion of the triangles covering the xz frame and some holes for a powersupply and the electronics have been added. 

[Here] (http://youtu.be/In_Q6NkX3fs) you can find a video showing how to assemble the frame.

The plastic parts have mostly been sourced from the box design of the main Prusa i3 branch.

The shroud was sourced from [this](http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:165606) made by stratop80, also [available on tinkercad](https://tinkercad.com/things/1gkTvnWGP8F). Although it was revised and only used for inspiration.

The new plastic parts made were the following:

The shroud for the fan.

The legs for the screen.

There are some add-ons for the printer in this folder

The source for the Y-endstop holder for the moving y-carriage can be found here [here] (https://www.youmagine.com/designs/y-endstop-support-for-p3steel) is made by Antonio Navarro

An alternative to the shroud that was provided during the workshop is found [here] (http://www.thingiverse.com/thing:268372) and is made by Diego García
